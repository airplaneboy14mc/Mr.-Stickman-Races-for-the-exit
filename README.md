This explains development progress.

**Note - I know I did not release very much, I did not release a whole lot of Alpha releases, only one, but it has a full version that I am preparing to release soon. (06/09/21)

Beta 1.0.1 (Beta) - This release I am going to play around with making the game fullscreen and making the game stretch to the full screen.

Release 1.0.0 (Main) - This has all of the basic code and files compiled, it does not have a fullscreen feature but is being worked on, only contains 1 level and will eventually be receiving more updates, I cannot guaruntee the frequency of these updates though.

NON_RELEASED_ALPHAS - Added critical files to the folder and added more code structure

Alpha 0.0.1 (Alpha) - Contains little code, but a majority of the required files to run the game
